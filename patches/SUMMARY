000_base.patch    Fixes to CPUID
                  Avoid dragging in BIO functions
                  rsa_x931 - allow 512 bit keys, up MR rounds with 
                  keysize

		  Avoid repeated include of some headers. 
                  reenable MD2

		  A few changes that were in 000 but broke with changes
                  to beta 1.1.0, plus ec_lib.c, make sure EC innards
                  are scrubbed on free

001_keytests.patch FIPS required limits on duplicate keys etc

002_platforms.patch Miscellaneous patches needed to build on IBM's 
	          (old) build OS's

003_AIX.patch     Fix problems with CPUID on Power

004_hpux.patch    pthread_once() on hpux PA-RISC doesn't. Work around that.

005_misc.patch    Fixes small problems found in test. Test/build failures
                  caused by compiler quirks on various platforms.
	          Add a means to allow 2key 3DES so we can pass the FIPS
		  tests.

006_lock_contention.patch
	          - reduce the rate at which the shared RSA bliding value is 
                    rolled over.

007_zOS.patch     zOS support

008_BN_STACK_pop.patch This function will pop an empty stack on error paths
	          - impacts ICC because we replace the OpenSSL RNG's and
                  - poison the RNG to the extent that it fails in testing

009_KeyGen.patch  RSA key gen, Xp1,Xp2 should be odd.

010_dh.patch      Add a DH keygen method that uses the subprime q. 
		  ( for TLS LTS support)

011_version.patch  Disable OpenSSL version info. Request from products as
		   man + dog runs scanners and picks us up as
		   "OpenSSL-<something>" and tags us as vulnerable to
		   defects we don't have. 

012_ppc.patch       Assorted patches for the Power platform

013_RSA_keygen.patch Fix OpenSSL RSA keygen timing leak. [16-April 2018] 

014_x86.patch       ICC_CAP_MASK should return the configured capabilities,
		     not the machine ones
		     Add back rdrand/rdseed functions that we use

015_conf.patch       Fix linkage problem.

016_EC_range.patch   Restore point is on curve check for NIST compliance

017_OS.patch         Fix platform specific problems on Sparc, Windows, Arm, s390

018_BN_free.patch    Kill residual information leak. BN_free()->BN_clear_free()

019_no_inline.patch  Suppress inline functions in internal headers needed
                     for key erasure tests.

020_zseries.patch   Mega zSeries patch. EC asm, zOS, misc bug fixes

021_misc.patch      Misc patches from updating to 1.1.1c

022_RNG_source.patch Pull nonces,padding,IV's etc from PRNG's not the TRNG
	            Two considerations, perfomance and you really don't want
                    to leak TRNG state in these routines. (=>Dual EC exploit)
025_zOS.patch       Patches to enable asm on zOS/zOS31. 
028_PPC_cap.patch   Fix problems with mis-detection of Power capabilities
029_obj_data_EDCDIC.patch Faster object lookups on EBCDIC systems
030_EDXXXX.patch    ED448/25519 Hware accel for z/OS
031_zOS_kdsa.patch  KDSA fix for zOS
032_hmac.patch      Avoids malloc's within the HMAC object use cycle
                    Some OS's have malloc's with a single lock
034_EC_import.patch OpenSSL breaks import of ED/X 448/25519 private keys
035_zOS.patch       Fix missing defines in zOS headers
036_RSA.patch       Inserts the FIPS RSA method into the default RSA logic.
037_Power10.patch   Power10 detection for AIX
038_zosa.patch      Z/OS - 64 bit ascii mode.
039_Z_EC_nonce.patch Switch Z series from using the internal HW EC nonce to SW
                    (Can't do the NIST KA tests with a HW nonce)
040_Z_ECX.patch     Disable h/ware accel on Z for *448 *25519 EC
041_DH.patch        Key checks on keygen for DH and ECDH
042_osx.patch       Revert OS/X change which only works on current OS/X
043_ec_fips.patch   Turn off extra key checks after keygen when we aren't a FIPS module
044_dh_fips.patch   Turn off extra key checks after keygen when we aren't a FIPS module
046_rsa_d_blinding.patch Support for malformed keys from Java. 
		    Blinding to cover the case where the imported private key
                    doesn't have the public key.
